            Ministry of Ayush is implementing the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of
            National Ayush Mission (NAM) through States/UTs for providing better
            access to Ayush services by increasing the number of Ayush Hospitals
            and Dispensaries, upgrading Ayush hospitals/dispensaries,
            operationalizing Ayush Health and Wellness Centres by upgrading
            existing Ayush dispensaries and Sub Health Centres to provide
            comprehensive primary healthcare at the grassroots level with a
            focus on Ayush systems of medicine, mainstreaming of Ayush through
            co-location of Ayush facilities at Primary Health Centres (PHCs),
            Community Health Centres (CHCs) & District Hospitals (DHs), ensuring
            the availability of Ayush drugs and trained manpower, and Ayush
            Public Health programmes. NAM also aims at improving the quality of
            Ayush education through upgrading existing Ayush Educational
            Institutions and establishing new Ayush Colleges in the States where
            the availability of Ayush teaching institutions is inadequate in the
            Government Sector.

          Centralised Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS)
          is an online platform available to the citizens 24x7 to lodge their
          grievances to the public authorities on any subject related to service
          delivery. It is a single portal connected to all the
          Ministries/Departments of Government of India and States. Every
          Ministry and States have role-based access to this system. CPGRAMS is
          also accessible to the citizens through standalone mobile application
          downloadable through Google Play store and mobile application
          integrated with UMANG. The status of the grievance filed in CPGRAMS
          can be tracked with the unique registration ID provided at the time of
          registration of the complainant. CPGRAMS also provides an appeal
          facility to the citizens if they are not satisfied with the resolution
          by the Grievance Officer. After closure of grievance if the
          complainant is not satisfied with the resolution, he/she can provide
          feedback. If the rating is ‘Poor’ the option to file an appeal is
          enabled. The status of the Appeal can also be tracked by the
          petitioner with the grievance registration number.
